What is Sql
SQL is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases.
SQL stands for Structured Query Language
SQL lets you access and manipulate databases

What Can SQL do?
SQL can execute queries against a database
SQL can retrieve data from a database
SQL can insert records in a database
SQL can update records in a database
SQL can delete records from a database
SQL can create new databases
SQL can create new tables in a database
SQL can create stored procedures in a database
SQL can create views in a database
SQL can set permissions on tables, procedures, and views

what is RDBMS
RDBMS. Stands for "Relational Database Management System." An RDBMS is a DBMS designed specifically for relational databases. ... A relational database refers to a database that stores data in a structured format, using rows and columns. 
This makes it easy to locate and access specific values within the database.
The data in RDBMS is stored in database objects called tables. A table is a collection of related data entries and it consists of columns and rows.
Look at the "Customers" table:

Some of The Most Important SQL Commands
SELECT - extracts data from a database
UPDATE - updates data in a database
DELETE - deletes data from a database
INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database
CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database
ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database
CREATE TABLE - creates a new table
ALTER TABLE - modifies a table
DROP TABLE - deletes a table
CREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key)
DROP INDEX - deletes an index

The SQL CREATE TABLE Statement
The CREATE TABLE statement is used to create a new table in a database.

Syntax
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype,
    column2 datatype,
    column3 datatype,
   ....
);

Example :: create table Customer(ID int not null,Name varchar(30), Age int not null ,Address varchar(45), Salary int );

The SQL SELECT Statement
The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.
The data returned is stored in a result table, called the result-set.
SELECT Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
Exam  : Select custName,custAddress from Customer;
SELECT Syntax : select * from table_Name;
exam Select *from Customer;

Before starting SQL, relational databases have several point that are important to keep in mind.
RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.
Data Integrity : Store data only once and avoiding data duplication.
SQL Constraints : Constraints are the rules which are apply to table columns to store valid data and prevents the user to storing/entering invalid data into table columns.
Better security : Assign grant or privilege to a individual User. Using this grant user can store confidential data into table by using username or password.
Database Normalization : Database normalization is the process to store database data very efficiently. No need to store same data more then one time and reduce the Data redundancy.
Different types of relationships : One to one, One to many, Many to many
One to one relationship : merging for two tables.
One to many relationship : create a foreign key from an parent table to the child table.
Many to many relationship : create a new relation table.

SQL Process Flow
When you execute SQL query come to a SQL Server. SQL Server work is managing database, load balancing, transaction management etc. SQL server call to a actual physical database table and return the result.
This process is take small bit of time and depend of query and SQL server load.

The SQL WHERE Clause
The WHERE clause is used to filter records.
The WHERE clause is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition.
WHERE Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
Exam:select * from Customer where  mobileNo ='9689340410';
Note: The WHERE clause is not only used in SELECT statement, it is also used in UPDATE, DELETE statement, etc.!


DDL And DML
Data Definition Language: To create/modify data structures (tables) that will hold the data.
Data Manipulation Language: To create/modify/retrieve the actual data.

Most used commands:
DDL: Create, Alter, Drop, Truncate, Rename
DML: Select, Insert, Update, Delete, Merge

The SQL AlTER Command
ALTER TABLE statement in SQL Server (Transact-SQL) to add a column, modify a column, drop a column, rename a column or rename a table with syntax and examples.

Description
The SQL Server (Transact-SQL) ALTER TABLE statement is used to add, modify, or drop columns in a table.

Add column in table
You can use the ALTER TABLE statement in SQL Server to add a column to a table.

The syntax to add a column in a table in SQL Server
ALTER TABLE table_name
  ADD column_name column_definition;
Exam: Alter Table Customer add mobileNo varchar(10);

Data Definition Language (DDL) Statements
Data definition statement are use to define the database structure or table.

Statement	Description
CREATE	     Create new database/table.
ALTER	     Modifies the structure of database/table.
DROP	     Deletes a database/table.
TRUNCATE     Remove all table records including allocated table spaces.
RENAME	     Rename the database/table.

Data Manipulation Language (DML) Statements
Data manipulation statement are use for managing data within table object.

Statement	Description
SELECT	        Retrieve data from the table.
INSERT	        Insert data into a table.
UPDATE	        Updates existing data with new data within a table.
DELETE	        Deletes the records rows from the table.
MERGE	        MERGE (also called UPSERT) statements to INSERT new records or UPDATE existing records depending on condition matches or not.
LOCK TABLE	LOCK TABLE statement to lock one or more tables in a specified mode. Table access denied to a other users for the duration of your table operation.
CALL
EXPLAIN PLAN	Statements are supported in PL/SQL only for executed dynamically. CALL a PL/SQL program or EXPLAIN PATH access the data path.


UPDATE Statement

The SQL Server (Transact-SQL) UPDATE statement is used to update existing records in a table in a SQL Server database. There are 3 syntaxes for the UPDATE statement depending on whether you are performing a traditional update or updating one table with data from another table.

Syntax
The syntax for the UPDATE statement when updating one table in SQL Server (Transact-SQL) is:

UPDATE table SET column1 = expression1 where ColumnID =expression1

Example :: update Customer Set Address ='pune' where ID =1;

UPDATE table
SET column1 = expression1,
    column2 = expression2,
    ...
[WHERE conditions];
OR

The syntax for the UPDATE statement when updating one table with data from another table in SQL Server (Transact-SQL) is:
UPDATE table1
SET column1 = (SELECT expression1
               FROM table2
               WHERE conditions)
[WHERE conditions];
OR
The syntax for the SQL Server UPDATE statement when updating one table with data from another table is:
UPDATE table1
SET table1.column = table2.expression1
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON (table1.column1 = table2.column1)
[WHERE conditions];

Example
update Customer set Address='pune' where ID=2;


The SQL DELETE Statement
The DELETE statement is used to delete existing records in a table.

DELETE Syntax
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;

DELETE EXAMPLE
delete from Customer where ID=3;
Note: Be careful when deleting records in a table! Notice the WHERE clause in the DELETE statement. The WHERE clause specifies which record(s) should be deleted.
 If you omit the WHERE clause, all records in the table will be deleted!

What is Main Difference between Delete and Drop 
DROP
Drop command is used to delete the entire table from the database including records.
Syntax:
drop table tablename;
Query:
drop table employees;
We can also delete views,index and so on.

DELETE
Delete is a DATA MANIPULATION LANGUAGE command.We can delete a specific records from the table using the delete command.
Syntax:
delete from tablename where columnname=data;
Query:
delete from employees where employee_id=100;

The difference between TRUNCATE , DELETE and DROP is one of the most common interview question. 
 
TRUNCATE
TRUNCATE is a DDL command
TRUNCATE is executed using a table lock and whole table is locked for remove all records.
We cannot use Where clause with TRUNCATE.
TRUNCATE removes all rows from a table.
Minimal logging in transaction log, so it is performance wise faster.
TRUNCATE TABLE removes the data by deallocating the data pages used to store the table data and records only the page deallocations in the transaction log.
Identify column is reset to its seed value if table contains any identity column.
To use Truncate on a table you need at least ALTER permission on the table.
Truncate uses the less transaction space than Delete statement.
Truncate cannot be used with indexed views.

DELETE
DELETE is a DML command.
DELETE is executed using a row lock, each row in the table is locked for deletion.
We can use where clause with DELETE to filter & delete specific records.
The DELETE command is used to remove rows from a table based on WHERE condition.
It maintain the log, so it slower than TRUNCATE.
The DELETE statement removes rows one at a time and records an entry in the transaction log for each deleted row.
Identity of column keep DELETE retain the identity.
To use Delete you need DELETE permission on the table.
Delete uses the more transaction space than Truncate statement.
Delete can be used with indexed views.

DROP
The DROP command removes a table from the database.
All the tables' rows, indexes and privileges will also be removed.
No DML triggers will be fired.
The operation cannot be rolled back.
DROP and TRUNCATE are DDL commands, whereas DELETE is a DML command.
DELETE operations can be rolled back (undone), while DROP and TRUNCATE operations cannot be rolled back.
